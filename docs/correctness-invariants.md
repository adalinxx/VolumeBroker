# Correctness invariants

"Published" means visible to presence, whole-Volume fetch, and per-CID fetch.
Retention never substitutes for publication.

| ID | Law |
| --- | --- |
| VOLUME-001 | The declared root is present in the Volume. |
| VOLUME-002 | Every `(CID, bytes)` pair uses the repository's canonical CID spelling and validates using its declared digest length. |
| VOLUME-003 | A batch owns a copied snapshot and publishes all valid Volumes or none. |
| VOLUME-004 | Valid existing CID content cannot acquire different bytes; invalid local bytes may be repaired only by submitted bytes that authenticate to that CID. |
| VOLUME-005 | An existing Volume root cannot acquire different membership. |
| VOLUME-006 | Declared count, membership, and root membership must agree before publication. Foreign keys guarantee every member has a CAS row and metadata; the schema guarantees an integer, positive declared count. |
| VOLUME-007 | Cashew completes one independently durable selected Volume per `VolumeStorer` callback; a caller with a preassembled all-or-none batch may use `storeVolumesLocal`. |
| VOLUME-008 | Loose CAS rows and incomplete membership grant no visibility; requested bytes are returned only after CID validation. |
| VOLUME-009 | Retained-root sets accept only complete local roots, all-or-none. A root is live if retained, or if it is a member of a live, complete Volume and is itself a stored Volume root. One recursive definition drives the sweep; `MemoryBroker` mirrors it. |
| VOLUME-010 | Retained-set replacement and merge are naturally idempotent. Advance replaces the whole set, so a caller that both merges and advances one scope serializes them. |
| VOLUME-011 | `sweep` removes every non-live Volume and then every unowned CAS row in one transaction, serialized with stores and advances; it has no grace window. |
| VOLUME-012 | Shared CAS bytes remain until their last owning Volume is removed. |
| VOLUME-013 | Immutable `near` and `far` links are read tiers in one domain; writes and cross-domain synchronization are explicit. |
| VOLUME-014 | Empty v0 initializes atomically; malformed, nonempty, and unsupported schemas are not mutated. |
| VOLUME-015 | Chain state, canonicity, and application metadata cannot bypass the Volume contract. |
| VOLUME-016 | Presence and liveness use the structural gate; a point read validates only its requested `(CID, bytes)`, while a whole-Volume read validates the whole Volume. |
| VOLUME-017 | Corrupt bytes fail CID validation on read and are not served; nothing is flagged or deleted, liveness is unchanged, and a valid re-store overwrites them. |
| VOLUME-018 | SQLite WAL with `synchronous=FULL` is the durable-commit boundary: a returned store survives a crash, so a later advance never names lost content. |
| VOLUME-019 | A batched CID read applies the same complete-owner serve gate, CID validation and local-to-far precedence as scalar reads. |

A read never writes: corruption only hides the corrupt bytes from readers, so a
database error or a corrupt leaf can never shrink what a retained root keeps.
