# VolumeBroker

Atomic, Volume-granular content-addressed storage for
[Cashew](https://github.com/adalinxx/cashew).

A `SerializedVolume` is one root CID plus the exact `(CID, bytes)` entries
published with it. VolumeBroker stores that set as one unit. It never walks DAG
links; the only relationship it knows is Volume membership. It knows nothing
about chains.

## Contract

- A Volume is visible only after its complete, CID-valid entry set commits.
- Valid CID bytes and Volume membership are immutable.
- Reads may fall through `local -> near -> far`; writes target one broker.
- Retained roots keep everything reachable from them through Volume membership;
  `sweep` removes the rest.
- Equal CIDs are deduplicated within each broker tier.

One cascade is one storage domain. Use separate brokers or database paths when
data must be isolated.

## Usage

```swift
import VolumeBroker

let disk = try DiskBroker(path: "/var/lib/my-app/volumes.sqlite")
let memory = MemoryBroker(near: disk)
```

Reads now try memory and then disk. Stores remain explicit.

Let Cashew produce valid Volume boundaries:

```swift
// Store the root and one selected nested Volume.
try await root.store(
    paths: [["accounts", "alice"]: .targeted],
    storer: disk
)
```

`.recursive` selects every nested Volume below a path. Each emitted Volume is
still an independent storage and retention unit. Cashew submits one Volume per
storer callback; callers that already hold an all-or-none batch can use
`storeVolumesLocal` to commit it in one transaction.

Resolve through the read cascade:

```swift
let resolved = try await unresolvedRoot.resolveRecursive(source: memory)
```

`VolumeBroker.fetch(_:)` resolves each Cashew frontier with one batched read per
storage tier.

## Retention

A scope is a name; a retained root is a complete stored Volume root. Advancing
a scope atomically replaces its root set and refuses any root that is not a
complete stored Volume, so a retained root never names content the broker lacks:

```swift
try await disk.advanceRetainedRoots(scope: "canonical", roots: [stateRoot])
```

`mergeRetainedRoots` adds roots without replacing the set. Replacing a scope
with the same set and merging roots already in it are naturally idempotent.

A Volume root is live if a scope retains it, or if it is a member CID of a
live, complete Volume and is itself a stored Volume root. Liveness is recursive.

```swift
let removed = try await disk.sweep()
```

`sweep` removes every Volume that is not live, then every CAS row no surviving
Volume owns, in one transaction. It has no grace window: content stored but not
yet retained is swept, and a later advance naming it is refused. Callers store,
then advance, and sweep only between their own commits.

## Implementations

- `MemoryBroker` is the in-memory twin with identical retention semantics.
- `DiskBroker` uses SQLite, WAL, foreign keys, and schema v2 validation. With
  `synchronous=FULL`, each commit is fsynced to the WAL before it returns, so a
  `store` that returns survives a crash.
- Every broker is directly usable as Cashew's `VolumeStorer`, `ContentSource`,
  and `Fetcher`.

`DiskBroker` initializes only an empty v0 database. Any other version, including
v1 (owner/count pins), fails closed with `migrationRequired`; rebuild from a new
database path. Malformed v2 schemas fail closed.

## Boundary

| VolumeBroker owns | The caller owns |
| --- | --- |
| Volume validation and atomic publication | DAG traversal and Volume selection |
| Local CAS, read cascading, and the reachability sweep | Storage placement and domain isolation |
| Retained-root sets and recursive reachability | Which roots are retained, and when to sweep |
| Storage integrity | Application state, canonicity, and consensus |
